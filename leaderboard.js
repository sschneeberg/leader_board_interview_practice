Exercise Goal:
    - The goal of this exercise is to show us how you apply software engineering 
    principles to create a maintainable software solution.

    How to approach this:

            - Don't worry about persistence. It would make sense here, but for this
            exercise only use in-memory data structures.
            - Don't worry about tricks or "gotchyas", as there aren't any.
            - Just focus on writing clean maintainable code.



Specification:

    Create a class LeaderBoard whose interface includes the following methods:

    Method Name: add_score

        - Add a new score to the player's average. If a player doesn't exist in the 
        LeaderBoard, they will be automatically added.

        Args:

                player_id (Integer): The player's ID.
                score (Integer): The score to record for the player

        Returns:

                Double: The new average score for the given player

    Method Name: top

        - Get the top player_ids on the leaderboard ordered by their average scores
        from highest to lowest

        Args:

                num_players (Integer): The maximum number of player_ids to return

        Returns:

                List<Integer>: a list of player_ids

    Method Name: reset

        - Removes any scoring information for a player, effectively 
        resetting them to 0

        Args:

                player_id (Integer): The player's ID.

Example Usage:


    // Create a new LeaderBoard Instance
    LeaderBoard leader_board = new LeaderBoard();

    // Add scores for players to the LeaderBoard
    leader_board.add_score(1, 50); // 50.0
    leader_board.add_score(2, 80); // 80.0
    leader_board.add_score(2, 70); // 75.0
    leader_board.add_score(2, 60); // 70.0
    leader_board.add_score(3, 90); // 90.0
    leader_board.add_score(3, 85); // 87.5

    // Get top positions for the leaderboard
    leader_board.top(3); // [3, 2, 1]
    leader_board.top(2); // [3, 2]
    leader_board.top(1); // [3]

    // Reset a player 3's scores
    leader_board.reset(3); // void

    // Player 3 is now at the bottom of the leaderboard
    leader_board.top(3); // [2, 1, 3]

Expected values

    - Player IDs will always be positive integers small enough to be 
    stored as a signed 32-bit integer Scores are integers ranging from 0-100
